    "\n",
    "In this mini project you will explore applications of POD and DMD to reduced order modelling. As both POD and DMD provide a low-rank basis on which high-dimensional fluid data can be projected, they provide an ideal way to reduce the complexity of the flow before a reduced order modelling technique is applied. The reduced order modelling technique we will consider is the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). The project consists of 6 questions with a total of 50 points."

    "With the SINDy procedure illustrated, let's explore reduced order modelling for fluid flow data. Specifically, let's consider flow past a cylinder at $\\textit{Re}=100$, which is a canonical fluid dynamics example often used to benchmark data-driven techniques. The vortex street seen in the wake of a cylinder arises from a Hopf Bifurcation at $\\textit{Re}\\approx47$. For Reynolds numbers below this there exists a steady solution to the governing equations. However, for Reynolds numbers greater than this critical value, instability gives rises to a periodic solution (the von Kármán vortex street). In the SINDy examples seen in this notebook so far, the data is already given in coordinates in which the governing equation is an ODE with sparse nonlinearities. However, fluid-flow data is inherently high dimensional and cannot easily be directly inputted to SINDy. For the rest of the mini project we will investigate how modal decomposition can be used to reduce the high dimensional flow data to a low-rank representation that SINDy can learn a model for.\n",
